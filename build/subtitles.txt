WHY??????

Target Companies (in ranking): Entertainment (books, movies, video games)
Company's Perspective:
ex) Video streaming providers (Netflix, Hulu, YouTube), Film/Movie producers, Scanlations team


Marketing Stategy -> to make these movies "available" and "understandable" to all people 
-> multiple subtitle options
-> multiple audio language options

Company Solution -> only make subtitles for most popular languages (English, Spanish)



WHY?????

Pain: Not all entertainment has the budget, availablity, or time to make product more 
available
Why don't movies have subtitles for all languages?
    - licsensing and show agreements
    - distract audience or cover the movie scenes
    - not popular enough
    - entertainment targets only specific people (restricted access to specific location)

Why do we need generative ai subtitles/translation technology?
    - helps company make their work undersatndable to different people
    - entertainment is a HUGE part of everyone's life 
    - large audience capable of using it
    - doesn't require licensing bc only needs producers permission

Problems:
-Privacy of a company's terms and agreements
    maybe they don't want their stuff to be restricted
